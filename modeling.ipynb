        "1. Accuracy: 0.5798 (57.98%)\n",
        "Accuracy measures the proportion of total correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) out of all predictions made. An accuracy of about 58% suggests that the model is performing better than random guessing (assuming a binary classification task with balanced classes), but it still incorrectly classifies a significant portion of the data.\n",
        "Implication: While the accuracy is somewhat moderate, it is not particularly high, indicating that the model might be struggling to generalize or distinguish between classes effectively.\n",
        "2. Precision: 0.3190 (31.90%)\n",
        "Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. A precision of about 32% means that when the model predicts an instance as positive, only about 32% of those predictions are actually correct.\n",
        "Implication: Low precision can be problematic if the cost of false positives is high. In contexts where false positives have serious implications, such as medical diagnostics or spam detection, you would ideally want a higher precision.\n",
        "3. Recall: 0.3103 (31.03%)\n",
        "Recall (or sensitivity) measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases (true positives) within the data. A recall of about 31% indicates that the model identifies about 31% of all actual positive cases.\n",
        "Implication: Low recall indicates many false negatives, where the model fails to detect many of the actual positives. This could be critical if it’s essential to capture as many positives as possible, for example in disease screening.\n",
        "4. F1-Score: 0.3146 (31.46%)\n",
        "The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a way of combining both precision and recall into a single measure that captures both properties. An F1 score of about 31% is quite low, suggesting that the model is not very effective at correctly classifying the positive class in particular.\n",
        "Implication: A low F1 score is indicative of problems in both precision and recall. It suggests that not only does the model identify few positives, but many of those it does identify are incorrect.\n",
        "5. AUC-ROC: 0.5058 (50.58%)\n",
        "The Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC-ROC) is a performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. AUC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes. An AUC of about 50.58% is very close to 50%, which is no better than random guessing in binary classification.\n",
        "Implication: This suggests that the model has no discriminative power to distinguish between positive and negative class labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the model’s performance metrics suggest it is not performing effectively, especially in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Hence we will be using BioBERT model which is specifically pre-trained on biomedical literature, BioBERT could capture the domain-specific nuances better than BERT."
